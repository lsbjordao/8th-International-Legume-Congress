          <h3>Leguminosae: states and fates of the Brazilian flora conservation</h3>
          <p>Lucas S.B. Jordão</p>

        <section>
          <p>
            Brazil is home to a significant proportion of Leguminosae species, comprising 13.5% of the global total.
            Furthermore, 51% of these species are endemic to the country, representing 7% of the worldwide Leguminosae
            diversity. Of the 3,068 species in Brazil, 1,024 (33%) underwent conservation assessments, carried out
            collaboratively with numerous specialists partnered with CNCFlora/JBRJ. Among the assessed species, 73% were
            not deemed threatened, including 56% classified as Least Concern (LC), 12% as Data Deficient (DD), and 5% as
            Near Threatened (NT). However, 277 (26%) are facing the risk of extinction, with 154 (5%) categorized as
            Endangered (EN), 81 (2.6%) as Vulnerable (VU), and 42 (1.3%) as Critically Endangered (CR). Most of
            threatened species belong to the genus <i>Mimosa</i> (23%), followed by <i>Swartzia</i> (14%) and
            <i>Chamaecrista</i>i> (10%). Most of
            the threatened species consist of trees (49%), followed by shrubs (30%). Among phytogeographic domains, the
            Atlantic Forest is home to 119 (43%) threatened species, followed by the Cerrado with 78 (28%) species. If
            we focus on combined characteristics such as habit and phytogeographic domain, <i>Swartzia</i> stands out in
            first
            place in the Amazon and among trees species, followed by <i>Peltogyne</i>, <i>Inga</i>, and
            <i>Tachigali</i>. Half of the
            genus <i>Muellera</i> (10 spp.), predominantly composed of tree species, are considered threatened. If we
            consider the vegetation type, dense ombrophilous rainforest emerges in first place with 100 (36%) species,
            followed
            by campos rupestres with 54 (20%) species. Among the Brazilian states, Bahia (17%), Minas Gerais (15%), Rio
            de
            Janeiro (11%), Goiás (10%), and Amazonas (8%) stand out as the top five with the highest number of
            threatened species. However, it is important to note that a significant 71% of all threatened species are
            endemic to a
            single state, highlighting the crucial role of state-level engagement in developing effective policies for
            the
            protection of threatened species. Criterion B, encompassing EOO (Extent of Occurrence), AOO (Area of
            Occupancy), number of locations, and continuous decline, has been extensively employed, accounting for 91%
            of the assessments conducted. This is partly due to the substantial scarcity of population and reproductive
            data. However, the availability of historical land cover classification data from the MapBiomas initiative
            has
            prompted efforts to utilize this information as primary data for analyzing parameters of continuous decline
            and determining location counts. Now, we can leverage land evolution data to accurately quantify the
            magnitude of threats that confront a species. There is much more to explore when it comes to analyzing and
            integrating
            various data sources, employing data modeling techniques, and creating informative presentations. However,
            the true potential lies in the development of robust information systems that offer scalability, enabling us
            to
            effectively handle vast and decentralized datasets. By implementing such systems, we can automate the
            monitoring process of available data sets on taxon distribution and prioritize conservation actions. This
            enables the establishment of an objective framework for comprehensively monitoring the entire biota.

        <p>Good day, everyone! My name is Lucas, and I'm delighted to be here today to discuss the current status and
          future prospects of Brazilian Legumes conservation.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>1</h1>
        <p>Brazil is home to 3,068 species of Leguminosae. 51% of these are endemic to the country. That represents
          7% of the worldwide Leguminosae diversity.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>2</h1>
        <p>With this treemap, we can see the richest genera of the family that occur in Brazil.</p>
        <p><i>Mimosa</i>, <i>Chamaecrista</i>, <i>Inga</i>, and <i>Swartzia</i> are the richest genera in the country
        </p>
        <p>Let's take a closer look at the progress we have made in each Leguminosae genus.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>3</h1>
        <p>33% of Brazilian Legumes species underwent conservation assessments.
        <p>
        <p>In this chart, we can see the number of species assessed, represented by the light colors, and the number of
          species yet to be assessed, represented by the darker shades.</p>
        <p>The assessments were conducted collaboratively with the valuable participation of numerous specialists who
          partnered with CNCFlora.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>4</h1>
        <p>Of the assessed species, 73% were not deemed threatened.</p>
        <p>Recently, CNCFlora along with partners conducted a workshop where we used a method to screen non-threatened
          species based on the extrapolation of EOO and AOO values. As a result, we completed 356 assessments of least
          concern species in just two days.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, a significant 12% of the species are Data Deficient, indicating the need for more studies about
          these species, and 5% are categorized as Near Threatened.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>5</h1>
        <p>However, 277 are facing extinction risk. Most part are Endangered, followed by Vulnerable and Critically
          Endangered.</p>

      <section>
        <h1>6/2</h1>
        <p>Among the Endangered species, <i>Mimosa</i> and <i>Chamaecrista</i> once again stand out as the top genera,
          followed by <i>Swartzia</i>.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>6/3</h1>
        <p>Among the Vulnerable species, <i>Inga</i>, <i>Swartzia</i> and <i>Chamaecrista</i> are the top 3 genera.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>7</h1>
        <p>Now, let's see all the threatened categories together.</p>
        <p><i>Mimosa</i> is the champion genus in number of species and also in threatened species.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>7/1</h1>
        <p>A closer look in <i>Mimosa</i> shows that most part of threatened species are shrubs from Cerrado, followed
          by Atlantic domain. Most of them occur in rupestrian grasslands, and are from Minas Gerais State.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>7/2</h1>
        <p>Focusing on <i>Chamaecrista</i>, most of them are shrubs or subshrubs found in rupestrian grasslands in the
          Cerrado of Minas Gerais State.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>7/3</h1>
        <p>Focusing on <i>Chamaecrista</i>, most of them are shrubs or subshrubs found in rupestrian grasslands in the
          Cerrado of Minas Gerais State.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>8/1</h1>
        <p>Atlantic Forest is the phytogeographic domain with more threatened species, where <i>Inga</i> is the genus
          with
          more threatened species.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>8/2</h1>
        <p>In Cerrado (the Brazilian savanna), <i>Chamaecrista</i> stands out as the genus with the highest number of
          threatened species. Most of these species are from rupestrian grasslands.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>8/3</h1>
        <p>In its turn, in Amazon, <i>Swartzia</i> stands out as the genus with the highest number of threatened
          species.</p>
      </section>
      <section>

        <p>We have emphasized the crucial importance of establishing robust information systems to automate biodiversity
          monitoring.</p>
        <p>The implementation of robust systems facilitates scalability in assessments of extinction risk.</p>
        <p>We are building an objective framework for comprehensively monitor the distribution area of species.</p>
        <p>The technology stack employed in the development of this application is based on JavaScript and TypeScript
          languages operating within a NodeJS environment.</p>
        <p>Under the hood, our backend infrastructure is built on the powerful and widely adopted NestJS framework.</p>
        <p>NestJS integrates the Bull framework to implement a queue system for asynchronous processing, while
          bull-board creates a user-friendly interface based on the React framework.</p>
