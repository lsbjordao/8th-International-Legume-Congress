          <h3>Leguminosae: states and fates of the Brazilian flora conservation</h3>

            Brazil is home to a significant proportion of Leguminosae species, comprising 13.5% of the global total.
            Furthermore, 51% of these species are endemic to the country, representing 7% of the worldwide Leguminosae
            diversity. Of the 3,068 species in Brazil, 1,024 (33%) underwent conservation assessments, carried out
            collaboratively with numerous specialists partnered with CNCFlora/JBRJ. Among the assessed species, 73% were
            not deemed threatened, including 56% classified as Least Concern (LC), 12% as Data Deficient (DD), and 5% as
            Near Threatened (NT). However, 277 (26%) are facing the risk of extinction, with 154 (5%) categorized as
            Endangered (EN), 81 (2.6%) as Vulnerable (VU), and 42 (1.3%) as Critically Endangered (CR). Most of
            threatened species belong to the genus *Mimosa* (23%), followed by *Swartzia* (14%) and *Chamaecrista* (10%). Most of
            the threatened species consist of trees (49%), followed by shrubs (30%). Among phytogeographic domains, the
            Atlantic Forest is home to 119 (43%) threatened species, followed by the Cerrado with 78 (28%) species. If
            we focus on combined characteristics such as habit and phytogeographic domain, *Swartzia* stands out in first
            place in the Amazon and among trees species, followed by *Peltogyne*, *Inga*, and *Tachigali*. Half of the
            genus *Muellera* (10 spp.), predominantly composed of tree species, are considered threatened. If we
            consider the vegetation type, dense ombrophilous rainforest emerges in first place with 100 (36%) species, followed
            by campos rupestres with 54 (20%) species. Among the Brazilian states, Bahia (17%), Minas Gerais (15%), Rio de
            Janeiro (11%), Goiás (10%), and Amazonas (8%) stand out as the top five with the highest number of
            threatened species. However, it is important to note that a significant 71% of all threatened species are endemic to a
            single state, highlighting the crucial role of state-level engagement in developing effective policies for the
            protection of threatened species. Criterion B, encompassing EOO (Extent of Occurrence), AOO (Area of
            Occupancy), number of locations, and continuous decline, has been extensively employed, accounting for 91%
            of the assessments conducted. This is partly due to the substantial scarcity of population and reproductive
            data. However, the availability of historical land cover classification data from the MapBiomas initiative has
            prompted efforts to utilize this information as primary data for analyzing parameters of continuous decline
            and determining location counts. Now, we can leverage land evolution data to accurately quantify the
            magnitude of threats that confront a species. There is much more to explore when it comes to analyzing and integrating
            various data sources, employing data modeling techniques, and creating informative presentations. However,
            the true potential lies in the development of robust information systems that offer scalability, enabling us to
            effectively handle vast and decentralized datasets. By implementing such systems, we can automate the
            monitoring process of available data sets on taxon distribution and prioritize conservation actions. This
            enables the establishment of an objective framework for comprehensively monitoring the entire biota.

        <p>We emphasize the crucial importance of establishing robust information systems to automate biodiversity
          monitoring.</p>
        <p>We are building an objective framework for comprehensively monitor the entire Brazilian biota.</p>
        <p>The implementation of these systems facilitates scalability in assessments of extinction risk.</p>
        <p>The technology stack employed in the development of this application is based on JavaScript and TypeScript
          languages operating within the NodeJS environment.</p>
        <p>Under the hood, our backend infrastructure is built on the powerful and widely adopted NestJS framework.</p>
        <p>NestJS integrates the Bull framework to implement a queue system, while bull-board creates a user-friendly
          interface based on the React framework.</p>

        <p>Here is the front-end of Bull-CNCFlora, an application designed to facilitate the scaling-up of conservation
          assessments for Brazilian species.</p>
        <p>The Bull-CNCFlora utilizes a powerful queue system that manage background jobs, guaranteeing efficiency and
          asynchronous execution of workflows, in which we can chain processes, easy monitoring of progress and catch
          errors, to ensure a smooth data processing experience.</p>

        <p>For calculations of land cover evolution, we have successfully integrated Google Earth Engine into our NodeJS
          workflow using its client API. This integration enables us to leverage the advanced cloud processing
          capabilities of Google Earth Engine, allowing us to process the time series data obtained from all MapBiomas
          plataforms.</p>

          which has made our participation in this congress possible.</p>
        <p>On behalf of CNCFlora, we express our deep gratitude to all taxonomists who have collaborated and continue to
