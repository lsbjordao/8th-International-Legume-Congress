          <h3>Leguminosae: states and fates of the Brazilian flora conservation</h3>
          <p>Lucas S.B. Jordão</p>

          <p>
            Brazil is home to a significant proportion of Leguminosae species, comprising 13.5% of the global total.
            Furthermore, 51% of these species are endemic to the country, representing 7% of the worldwide Leguminosae
            diversity. Of the 3,068 species in Brazil, 1,024 (33%) underwent conservation assessments, carried out
            collaboratively with numerous specialists partnered with CNCFlora/JBRJ. Among the assessed species, 73% were
            not deemed threatened, including 56% classified as Least Concern (LC), 12% as Data Deficient (DD), and 5% as
            Near Threatened (NT). However, 277 (26%) are facing the risk of extinction, with 154 (5%) categorized as
            Endangered (EN), 81 (2.6%) as Vulnerable (VU), and 42 (1.3%) as Critically Endangered (CR). Most of
            threatened species belong to the genus <i>Mimosa</i> (23%), followed by <i>Swartzia</i> (14%) and
            <i>Chamaecrista</i> (10%). Most of
            the threatened species consist of trees (49%), followed by shrubs (30%). Among phytogeographic domains, the
            Atlantic Forest is home to 119 (43%) threatened species, followed by the Cerrado with 78 (28%) species. If
            we focus on combined characteristics such as habit and phytogeographic domain, <i>Swartzia</i> stands out in
            first
            place in the Amazon and among trees species, followed by <i>Peltogyne</i>, <i>Inga</i>, and
            <i>Tachigali</i>. Half of the
            genus <i>Muellera</i> (10 spp.), predominantly composed of tree species, are considered threatened. If we
            consider the vegetation type, dense ombrophilous rainforest emerges in first place with 100 (36%) species,
            followed
            by campos rupestres with 54 (20%) species. Among the Brazilian states, Bahia (17%), Minas Gerais (15%), Rio
            de
            Janeiro (11%), Goiás (10%), and Amazonas (8%) stand out as the top five with the highest number of
            threatened species. However, it is important to note that a significant 71% of all threatened species are
            endemic to a
            single state, highlighting the crucial role of state-level engagement in developing effective policies for
            the
            protection of threatened species. Criterion B, encompassing EOO (Extent of Occurrence), AOO (Area of
            Occupancy), number of locations, and continuous decline, has been extensively employed, accounting for 91%
            of the assessments conducted. This is partly due to the substantial scarcity of population and reproductive
            data. However, the availability of historical land cover classification data from the MapBiomas initiative
            has
            prompted efforts to utilize this information as primary data for analyzing parameters of continuous decline
            and determining location counts. Now, we can leverage land evolution data to accurately quantify the
            magnitude of threats that confront a species. There is much more to explore when it comes to analyzing and
            integrating
            various data sources, employing data modeling techniques, and creating informative presentations. However,
            the true potential lies in the development of robust information systems that offer scalability, enabling us
            to
            effectively handle vast and decentralized datasets. By implementing such systems, we can automate the
            monitoring process of available data sets on taxon distribution and prioritize conservation actions. This
            enables the establishment of an objective framework for comprehensively monitoring the entire biota.

        <h1>Open</h1>
        <p>Good day, everyone! My name is Lucas, and I'm delighted to be here today to discuss the current status and
          future prospects of Brazilian Legumes conservation.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>1</h1>
        <p>There are 778 Legume genera in the world. In Brazil, we have 143 genera, in which 18 are endemic to the
          country, but there are significant 33 others that most of their species are distributed in Brazil.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>2</h1>
        <p>This is the list of the 18 endemic genera.</p>
        <p>The responsability to protect them is completely ours.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>3</h1>
        <p>Here, we encounter the most Brazilian genera, as the majority of their species are distributed in Brazil.</p>
        <p><i>Leucochloron</i>, <i>Poecilanthe</i>, <i>Exostyles</i>, <i>Poiretia</i>, <i>Collea</i>,
          <i>Cerradicola</i>, <i>Luetzelburgia</i> have over 70% of their species are native from Brazil.
        </p>
        <p>But look the importance of Chamaecrista</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>3/1</h1>
        <p>And observe <i>Mimosa</i> that has 46% of its species in the country.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>4</h1>
        <p>Now, in terms of species, there are 22,323 (twenty-two thousand, three hundred and twenty-three) species.
          12.8% of them are native from Brazil.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>5</h1>
        <p>So, Brazil is home to 2,857 native Legume species. 55% of these are endemic to the
          country.</p>
        <p>Much more attention has been directed towards endemic species in Brazil.</p>
        <p>Of the assessed species, 277 are facing extinction risk. 255 plus 22 of the non endemic species.</p>
        <p>Most part are Endangered, followed by Vulnerable and Critically Endangered.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>6</h1>
        <p>With this treemap, we can examine our progress in each genera. The size of the square indicates the number of
          species. Inside each square, we see the number of species
          already assessed, in light colors, as well as the number of species yet to be assessed, in darker shades.</p>
        <p>The assessments were conducted collaboratively with the valuable participation of numerous specialists who
          partnered with CNCFlora.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>7</h1>
        <p>Let's see all the threatened categories together.</p>
        <p><i>Mimosa</i> is the champion genus in number of species and also in threatened species.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>8</h1>
        <p>With the help of MapBiomas data, we can leverage land evolution data to accurately quantify the magnitude of
          threats that confront a species.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h1>9</h1>
        <p>Much more could be presented about each species. However, the true potential lies in the development of
          robust information systems that offer scalability, flexibility, and growth.</p>
        <p>We are building an objective and reproductive framework for comprehensively monitor the land cover evolution <mark>within</mark> the
          distribution area of species.</p>
        <p>The technology stack employed in the development of this application is based on JavaScript and TypeScript
          languages operating within a NodeJS environment.</p>
        <p>Under the hood, our backend infrastructure is built on the powerful and widely adopted NestJS framework.</p>
        <p>NestJS integrates the Bull framework to implement a queue system for asynchronous processing, while the
          Bull-board creates a user-friendly interface based on the React framework.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>9/1</h1>
        <p>For calculations of land cover evolution, we have successfully integrated Google Earth Engine into our NodeJS
          workflow using its client API. This integration enables us to leverage the advanced cloud processing
          capabilities of Google Earth Engine, allowing us to process the time series data obtained from all MapBiomas
          plataforms.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h1>9/2</h1>
        <p>Here is the front-end of the Bull-CNCFlora, an application designed to facilitate the scaling-up of
          conservation assessments for Brazilian species.</p>
        <p>The Bull-CNCFlora utilizes a powerful queue system that manage background jobs, guaranteeing efficiency and
          asynchronous execution of workflows, in which we can chain processes, easy monitoring of progress and catch
          errors, to ensure a smooth data processing experience.</p>
